		<li>The Management (Honors) program is the most distinguished program of the Ateneo School of Management. The program covers each facet of management, with a heavy focus on entrepreneurship. Only around 10 people usually graduate from this program, starting from about 80 people. </li>
		<li>At the same time, my chosen courses had a heavy focus on finance - tackling all foundational areas such as financial reporting, valuation of companies, projects, and financial instruments, corporate finance, portfolio management, and economics. </li>
		<li>My culmination project was the creation and management of a small business - Dajun Artisan Granola. As a team of six students, we handled operations, marketing, sales, and finance for a home-grown business that sold healthy snacks. I acted as operations manager, ensuring that production was efficient and I kept meticulous records of ingredients and costing. </li>
